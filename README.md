## Technical Challenges

### 1. UI/UX Design
Creating an aesthetically pleasing yet functional UI was a significant challenge. Key focus areas included achieving consistent alignment, ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes, and maintaining readability.

### 2.View Binding & Navigation:

Implementing View Binding for smoother view management and setting up navigation between different activities was an initial challenge. Ensuring seamless transitions and correct lifecycle handling required careful management.
Managing System UI Insets:

Handling system UI elements like the status bar and navigation bars using WindowInsetsCompat was complex, especially for edge-to-edge layouts, which required additional padding management for a visually appealing interface.


# Future Plans
## Implement Full Functionality:

We plan to implement Quran and Hadith browsing, including search and bookmark features, alongside full Dua collections. The Qibla direction feature will also integrate real-time location updates for precision.
Settings and Customization:

Future iterations will include Settings for language options, app themes, and notification preferences for prayer times and important events.
###Notifications:

Add notifications for prayer times, Islamic dates, and reminders for daily dua and hadith.
Authentication & User Profiles:

Support user login through social platforms, with personal bookmarks and progress tracking for reading Quran or Hadith.
# Conclusion
This project is an ongoing effort to create a fully-featured Islamic resource application, combining usability with a rich array of features for users. The current phase emphasizes design and initial navigation, with more features to come in future updates.
